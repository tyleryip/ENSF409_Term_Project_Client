# ENSF409_Term_Project_Client

There are README's for both the server and client located in "ENSF409_Term_Project" and "ENSF409_Term_Project_Client" respectively. Please read both of these before starting the program as they contain instructions on how the entire application must be run. In short, the server must be run first and it must have all the text files to run properly. Please do not edit these files manually as they follow a strict formatting. Also see the client README on how to operate the application from the client-side.
